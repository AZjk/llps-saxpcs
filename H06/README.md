### Synopsis

This folder scales the SAXS from H06 at different T, and plots:

1. Fitting of SAXS at different T using the Lorentzian function (Fig. a)
2. Overall scaled curve (inset)
3. Scaled coefficient as a function of temperature (Fig. b)

Suggestion: For each code, plot the intermediate data and save the processed result into some `.pickle` file. Use the final code only for assembling the figure and not data analysis.
